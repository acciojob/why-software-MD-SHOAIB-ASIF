	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>I want to be a developer because I'm genuinely passionate about technology and the creative problem-solving it involves. From a young age, I've been fascinated by the potential of software to transform our world. I see coding as a way to bring ideas to life and have a tangible impact on people's lives.</p>
